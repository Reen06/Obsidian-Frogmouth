Great question ‚Äî that **`hydra/`** and **`hydra_logs/`** (or `hydra.log`) folder is totally normal when you run Isaac Lab‚Äôs RL training scripts.  
It‚Äôs not part of the model itself ‚Äî it‚Äôs part of the **Hydra configuration system** that Isaac Lab uses to manage all the training settings and logging.

Here‚Äôs the breakdown üëá

## üß† What Hydra Is

Hydra is a **configuration manager** made by Facebook (Meta) that Isaac Lab uses under the hood to handle:

- Command-line arguments (`--task`, `--num_envs`, etc.)
    
- Config files (like YAMLs defining PPO or PhysX parameters)
    
- Output directories and experiment naming
    
- Logging for what arguments and overrides were actually used
    

Basically, Hydra keeps every experiment‚Äôs settings organized and reproducible.

## üìÅ Inside the Hydra Folder

When you run something like:

```bash
python scripts/reinforcement_learning/skrl/train.py --task=Isaac-Ant-v0
```

Hydra automatically makes a folder in your working directory like this:

```
outputs/
  2025-10-08_22-31-59/
      hydra/
          config.yaml
          overrides.yaml
          hydra.yaml
      train.log
      wandb/
      checkpoints/
```

### Here‚Äôs what each Hydra file is:

|File|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**`config.yaml`**|The full merged configuration Hydra used for this run (it merges base config + your overrides). This is super useful for reproducing the run later.|
|**`overrides.yaml`**|Only the options you overrode manually in the command line (e.g. `--task`, `--num_envs`, etc.).|
|**`hydra.yaml`**|Hydra‚Äôs own internal metadata about logging and working directory paths.|
|**`hydra.log`**|Text log of Hydra‚Äôs operations (where it saved files, any errors in config merging, etc.).|

---

## üìä Why It Matters

- It **doesn‚Äôt affect training** directly ‚Äî it‚Äôs purely configuration bookkeeping.
    
- It‚Äôs **safe to delete** old Hydra folders if you don‚Äôt need them.
    
- But keeping them helps if you ever want to reproduce or compare runs ‚Äî you can just re-run with the same Hydra config.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Hydra Configuration

### **Custom Output Directory:**
If you want to change where Hydra puts output (for example, to always log inside your `runs/` folder), you can add a flag:

```bash
--config-dir configs --config-name train hydra.run.dir=./runs/${now:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S}
```

That moves all Hydra output into a timestamped `runs/` directory automatically.

### **Hydra Configuration Management:**
```bash
# Use custom config directory
isaaclab.bat -p scripts\reinforcement_learning\rsl_rl\train.py \
    --config-dir=my_configs \
    --config-name=custom_train

# Override multiple parameters
isaaclab.bat -p scripts\reinforcement_learning\rsl_rl\train.py \
    --task=Isaac-Ant-Direct-v0 \
    --agent=rsl_rl_ppo_cfg \
    agent.algorithm.learning_rate=0.001 \
    agent.policy.actor_hidden_dims=[512,512,256] \
    agent.algorithm.entropy_coef=0.01 \
    scene.num_envs=2048

# Custom output directory with timestamp
isaaclab.bat -p scripts\reinforcement_learning\rsl_rl\train.py \
    --task=Isaac-Ant-Direct-v0 \
    --agent=rsl_rl_ppo_cfg \
    hydra.run.dir=./experiments/\${now:%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M-%S}
```

### **Hydra Files Purpose:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`config.yaml`** | Full merged configuration Hydra used for this run |
| **`overrides.yaml`** | Only the options you overrode manually |
| **`hydra.yaml`** | Hydra's internal metadata about logging and paths |
| **`hydra.log`** | Text log of Hydra's operations |

Would you like me to make you a **simple folder map diagram** (like a labeled tree view) showing how Hydra logs, checkpoints, and scripts all connect in one training run? It makes it really easy to visualize what‚Äôs what.
