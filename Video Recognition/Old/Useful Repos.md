### 1) Input / capture / transport

- **OpenCV** (grab frames from webcams/RTSP/CSI; quick prototyping). ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision "GitHub - jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision: A curated list of awesome computer vision resources"))
    
- **GStreamer** (low-latency pipelines; hardware accel; RTSP/RTMP/WebRTC paths). ([GitHub](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GStreamer open-source multimedia framework"))
    
- **FFmpeg + wrappers** (ingest/transcode/filters; works with cameras, files, streams). See the FFmpeg “awesome” list (also points to Node/Python bindings like fluent-ffmpeg, etc.). ([GitHub](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome "GitHub - sindresorhus/awesome:  Awesome lists about all kinds of interesting topics"))
    
- Broadcasting/streaming catalog (handy for playout, ingest tools, transport streams, and live IP): **Awesome Broadcasting** and **Awesome Streaming**. ([GitHub](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting "GitHub - ebu/awesome-broadcasting: A curated list of amazingly awesome open source resources related to broadcast technologies"))
    

### 2) Understanding (do CV/AI on each frame/clip)

- **Object detection / segmentation:**  
    • **Ultralytics YOLOv8** (fast, easy, good realtime baseline). ([GitHub](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Ultralytics YOLO"))  
    • **OpenMMLab MMDetection** (modular PyTorch toolbox; tons of models). ([GitHub](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection?utm_source=chatgpt.com "open-mmlab/mmdetection: OpenMMLab Detection Toolbox ..."))
    
- **Tracking / multi-object tracking & video perception:**  
    • **OpenMMLab MMTracking** (VID/MOT/SOT/VIS in one toolbox). ([GitHub](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmtracking?utm_source=chatgpt.com "open-mmlab/mmtracking: OpenMMLab Video Perception ..."))
    
- **Pose estimation / action recognition (for “understanding” beyond boxes):** curated “awesome” lists with methods + code links:  
    • **Awesome Human Pose Estimation** (pose keypoints, realtime models). ([GitHub](https://github.com/wangzheallen/awesome-human-pose-estimation "GitHub - wangzheallen/awesome-human-pose-estimation: Human Pose Estimation Related Publication"))  
    • **Awesome Action Recognition** (clip-level spatiotemporal models). ([GitHub](https://github.com/jinwchoi/awesome-action-recognition "GitHub - jinwchoi/awesome-action-recognition: A curated list of action recognition and related area resources"))  
    • **Awesome Deep Learning for Video Analysis** (broad video tasks). ([GitHub](https://github.com/HuaizhengZhang/Awsome-Deep-Learning-for-Video-Analysis "GitHub - HuaizhengZhang/Awsome-Deep-Learning-for-Video-Analysis: Papers, code and datasets about deep learning and multi-modal learning for video analysis"))  
    These all hang under **Awesome Computer Vision / Deep Vision** in the main list. ([GitHub](https://github.com/jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision "GitHub - jbhuang0604/awesome-computer-vision: A curated list of awesome computer vision resources"))
    

### 3) Output / render / stream

- **GStreamer** (compose low-latency pipelines to display or stream out). ([GitHub](https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GStreamer open-source multimedia framework"))
    
- **FFmpeg** (encode/transcode; push RTMP/HLS/DASH; filter graphs). See the **Awesome FFmpeg** list for tooling and bindings. ([GitHub](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/awesome-ffmpeg "GitHub - transitive-bullshit/awesome-ffmpeg:  A curated list of awesome FFmpeg resources."))
    
- **Broadcast / playout tools** (CasparCG, etc.) are indexed in **Awesome Broadcasting** if you need studio-style graphics and playout. ([GitHub](https://github.com/ebu/awesome-broadcasting "GitHub - ebu/awesome-broadcasting: A curated list of amazingly awesome open source resources related to broadcast technologies"))
