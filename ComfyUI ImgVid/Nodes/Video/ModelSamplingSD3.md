## **Purpose of the ModelSamplingSD3 Node**

- It acts as a **controller** for the sampling behavior of the base model.
    
- It tweaks how noise is removed step-by-step, influencing:
    
    - Image/video **sharpness**.
        
    - **Consistency** between frames (important for video workflows like WAN 2.2 T2V).
        
    - The balance between **creativity vs. structure**.
        

Essentially, it fine-tunes the "path" the model takes when converting noise into a finished image or video.

## **Parameters**

### **1. model**

- Input for your **base diffusion model**, usually connected from the **Load Diffusion Model** node or a LoRA-enhanced model from **LoraLoaderModelOnly**.
    

Example connection:

```
Load Diffusion Model → LoraLoaderModelOnly → ModelSamplingSD3 → KSampler (Advanced)
```

This ensures the base model passes through this sampling node before the actual generation steps begin.

---

### **2. shift**

- **Default Value:** `5.00` (as shown in your screenshot)
    

The `shift` parameter directly controls how the sampling algorithm behaves by offsetting the internal noise schedule. Think of it as a way to "bias" the generation process:

|**Shift Value**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|**0–2**|Minimal effect, close to default Stable Diffusion behavior.|
|**3–5**|Moderate control; stabilizes generation and makes outputs more predictable.|
|**6+**|Strong adjustment; can cause very stylized or exaggerated changes.|

**Practical Recommendations:**

- Start at `5.0` (default).
    
- If your video frames are **inconsistent or flickering**, lower the shift to around `3.0–4.0`.
    
- If you want more **artistic, surreal results**, increase to `6.0–7.0`.
    

---

## **Output: MODEL**

- The output is a **modified model** object.
    
- This enhanced model is then plugged into **KSampler (Advanced)**, which handles the actual denoising and generation.
    

Pipeline connection:

```
ModelSamplingSD3 → KSampler (Advanced)
```

## **How It Fits Into Your Workflow**

With all the nodes you’ve shown so far, the order for the model portion should look like this:

```
Load Diffusion Model
      ↓
LoraLoaderModelOnly (optional, if using a LoRA)
      ↓
ModelSamplingSD3 (tweaks sampling behavior)
      ↓
KSampler (Advanced)
```

This ensures that:

1. The base model is loaded first.
    
2. LoRA modifications are applied.
    
3. Sampling behavior is refined before generation.
    
4. The KSampler uses these settings to generate final video frames.

## **When to Use ModelSamplingSD3**

This node is **optional** but very useful in specific cases:

- **Text-to-Video Generation (WAN 2.2 T2V)**:
    
    - Helps stabilize motion across frames.
        
    - Reduces flickering caused by random noise patterns.
        
- **Experimental Diffusion Techniques:**
    
    - For advanced workflows that require precise noise scheduling.
        
- **Creative Outputs:**
    
    - Pushes the model toward unique, stylized results without retraining.

## **Example Use Cases**

### **1. Smooth Video Generation**

Goal: Generate stable 640x640 81-frame video with minimal flickering.

- `shift = 4.0–5.0`
    
- Works well with WAN 2.2 base model and a subtle LoRA.
    

### **2. Creative Stylization**

Goal: Create highly artistic, dreamlike outputs.

- `shift = 6.5–7.5`
    
- Expect more dramatic frame-to-frame variations.
    

### **3. Standard Txt2Img**

Goal: Standard single image generation.

- `shift = 5.0` (default is fine).

## **Summary Table**

|Parameter|Description|Typical Value|
|---|---|---|
|**model**|Input model (base + optional LoRA merged)|Output from LoraLoaderModelOnly or Load Diffusion Model|
|**shift**|Adjusts sampling behavior for denoising|5.0 (default)|

## **Complete Video Workflow Integration**

Here’s how all your nodes fit together now:

```
Load CLIP → CLIP Text Encode (Positive Prompt)
          → CLIP Text Encode (Negative Prompt)

Load Diffusion Model → LoraLoaderModelOnly → ModelSamplingSD3 → KSampler (Advanced)

EmptyHunyuanLatentVideo → KSampler (Advanced)

Load VAE → VAE Decode → Video Output
```

This setup:

- Loads your model and LoRAs.
    
- Refines the sampling process with ModelSamplingSD3.
    
- Generates frames from an empty latent video.
    
- Decodes them into viewable frames for final export.

## **Quick Tips**

1. **If VRAM usage is high**, keep resolution and frame count low during testing.
    
2. **Adjust shift gradually** — small changes can have big effects.
    
3. Keep logs of settings for consistent video results.
