## **1. TTS (Text-to-Speech) – Local Speech Generation**

These tools turn **written text into speech** and run fully offline.

|**Tool**|**What It’s Best For**|**Difficulty**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Coqui TTS** [GitHub](https://github.com/coqui-ai/TTS)|High-quality voices, multiple languages, trainable|Moderate|Most versatile, great starting point|
|**Piper TTS** [GitHub](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper)|Lightweight and fast, works on low-power devices|Easy|Perfect for Raspberry Pi or small setups|
|**Tortoise TTS** [GitHub](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts)|Ultra-realistic voices|Harder, slower|Great quality, but very resource-heavy|

**Basic Local Workflow:**

```
Text Input
    --> TTS Engine (Coqui, Piper, or Tortoise)
    --> Audio File Output (.wav or .mp3)
```

- **Coqui TTS** is the best balance of quality and speed.
    
- **Piper** is lightweight and simple.
    
- **Tortoise** is slower but can sound almost human if you have a strong GPU.

## **2. AI Music Generation – Local Music/SFX Creation**

These are for **generating music or instrumental loops** directly on your PC.

|**Tool**|**What It’s Best For**|**Difficulty**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**MusicGen (Meta)** [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)|Instrumentals, loops, and basic songs|Moderate|Best free open-source option|
|**Riffusion** [GitHub](https://github.com/riffusion/riffusion)|Quick melody and riff generation|Easy|Fun and lightweight|
|**AudioCraft** [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)|Full toolkit for music and sound effects|Moderate/Advanced|Same project as MusicGen but more complete|

**Local Music Workflow:**

```
Prompt (e.g., "Epic orchestral theme with drums")
    --> MusicGen or AudioCraft
    --> WAV Output
```

- **MusicGen** is your best starting point for generating tracks on your GPU.
    
- **Riffusion** is very lightweight and real-time but more experimental.

## **3. Sound Effects & Foley – Local Environmental Sounds**

For **sound effects**, like footsteps, explosions, or ambient noise.

|**Tool**|**What It’s Best For**|**Difficulty**|
|---|---|---|
|**AudioCraft** [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft)|Game sounds, environmental audio, Foley|Moderate|

**Workflow:**

```
Prompt (e.g., "Creaking wooden door")
    --> AudioCraft SFX
    --> WAV Output
```

- **AudioCraft** can do both **music** and **sound effects**, making it the most versatile free option for audio generation.

## **4. Voice Cloning & Speech-to-Speech**

For **morphing your voice** into another voice or cloning a specific vocal style.

|**Tool**|**What It’s Best For**|**Difficulty**|**Notes**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)** [GitHub](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI)|Real-time voice changing or cloning|Moderate|Popular and very active project|
|**so-vits-svc** [GitHub](https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc)|Training and cloning voices from datasets|Harder|Best if you want custom voices|

**Workflow:**

```
Input Audio (Your voice)
    --> RVC or so-vits-svc
    --> Output Audio (Different voice/style)
```

> **Tip:**  
> RVC can run in real-time if you have a decent GPU, making it fun for streaming or live use.

## **5. Advanced Local Chained Workflows**

You can chain these tools together for complex audio production, all locally:

Example:

```
Text Script
    --> Coqui TTS (Dialogue)
    --> MusicGen (Background music)
    --> AudioCraft (Sound effects)
    --> DAW (Reaper, Audacity) for mixing
```

This is similar to how ComfyUI chains nodes but done manually with audio tools.

## **Summary of Local-Only Tools**

|**Goal**|**Recommended Tool**|
|---|---|
|Text-to-Speech|**Coqui TTS** or **Piper**|
|High-end realistic TTS|**Tortoise TTS**|
|AI music generation|**MusicGen**|
|Real-time music loops|**Riffusion**|
|Sound effects / Foley|**AudioCraft**|
|Voice cloning|**RVC**|
